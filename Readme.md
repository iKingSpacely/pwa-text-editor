# J.A.T.E (Just Another Text Editor)

## Description
Welcome to J.A.T.E.! J.A.T.E., otherwise known as Just Another Text Editor, is an app that allows you to take notes, create to do lists, etc. that will store to your local storage while you create notes/tasks. Everything you put into this app will load up even after you close out of the program thanks to your local storage. Upon initial use, you’ll be presented with a pretty cool J.A.T.E. header, too!
